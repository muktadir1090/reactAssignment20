## User Story

## Acceptance Criteria

- **Header, Content, and Footer Layout**: 
  - When the portfolio loads, the user is presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer.

  - On first load, the `About Me` section and title are selected by default.

- **About Me Section**: 
  - The section includes a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio.

  - Displays six titled images of the developer’s applications.
  - Each image links to the deployed application and its corresponding GitHub repository.
