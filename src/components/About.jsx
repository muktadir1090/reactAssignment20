      <p>I am a passionate and dedicated Software Engineer with a dual specialization in Web Development and Software Development in Testing (SDET). Over the past 8 years, I’ve honed my craft in both development and testing, bringing a comprehensive and well-rounded skill set to every project I work on. With 6 years of experience as an SDET and 2 years as a web developer, I have cultivated a deep technical expertise in building scalable, efficient, and robust web applications while ensuring their reliability through rigorous automated testing frameworks.

My experience spans across various industries, including projects for Fortune 500 companies, where I’ve been entrusted with high-impact, mission-critical tasks that demand precision and scalability. This has provided me with invaluable exposure to large-scale, complex systems that operate in high-demand environments, pushing me to design and develop solutions that not only meet immediate business needs but also anticipate future growth.

As a Web Developer, I have worked extensively on both the front end and back end, with a particular focus on creating intuitive, user-centric interfaces while ensuring seamless integration with backend services. I’m skilled in modern JavaScript frameworks such as React and Node.js, and I take pride in developing responsive, accessible, and high-performance applications that deliver exceptional user experiences. My ability to rapidly prototype and iterate on features ensures that projects remain agile and aligned with evolving business objectives.

In my SDET role, I’ve built robust automated testing frameworks from the ground up, integrating them seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines to accelerate deployment cycles and ensure flawless releases. I’ve worked closely with development teams to perform white-box testing, enhancing code quality and significantly reducing bug detection time. My contributions have consistently resulted in 80% or higher code coverage, improving the stability and reliability of the applications I’ve worked on.

Throughout my career, I have collaborated cross-functionally with diverse teams, leveraging Agile methodologies to deliver high-quality products on time. I’m not just focused on writing code—I’m deeply committed to crafting solutions that are maintainable, secure, and scalable. My work with Fortune 500 companies has equipped me with the ability to deliver under pressure, adapt quickly to new technologies, and always stay at the forefront of innovation.

I am excited by the prospect of tackling new challenges and contributing to the success of projects that have the potential to make a significant impact. My unique blend of development and testing expertise allows me to ensure that every aspect of a project, from concept to deployment, is handled with precision and care.

This version adds more detail about your technical skills, highlights your ability to work on both the development and testing sides, and provides examples of the impact you’ve had in high-profile environments, particularly with Fortune 500 companies.
